The RML file produced from the SXW file has been modified:

1. <para style="Standard">Duration: [[ session.duration or
   removeParentNode('para') ]]</para>

2. <para style="Standard">Percentage of remaining seats:
   <font color="black">[[session.remaining_seats_percent&lt;50
   and setTag('font','font',{'color':'red'})]]
   [[ formatLang(session.remaining_seats_percent,digits=2) ]]</font>

In 1., the para element that displays duration is removed if there is
no duration. I
n 2. the color of the font element is set to red if less than half the seats are available.
